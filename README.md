This app is a fun little guessing game where a user can guess which countries flag is which! The app will keep score and will tell a user whether their answer is right or wrong. The majority of this app was copy pasted from the 100 days of SwiftUI tutorial but the following challenges were completed and added by me:

 1. Add an @State property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert and in the score label.
 2. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
 3. Make the game show only 8 questions, at which point they see a final alert judging their score and can restart the game.

Overall, a very fun project and a great learning experience for me
